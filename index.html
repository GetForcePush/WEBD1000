                <div>
                    Hello and welcome! My name is Aaron. This website contains all sorts
                    of information aboout myself. There are personal coding samples as well as
                    some glorified lorem ipsum on the web samples page. This had to be done to fill out
                    the site, but once I get more projects under my belt I will change them to accuratly represent
                    my achievments. For now though, they will remain as filler information about
                    popular websites as though I had programmed them.
                </div>
                <h2>About me</h2>
                <div>
                    I'm an amatuer programmer, respected part time worker at Cineplex,
                    part time comedian, and I play games in my spare time. 
                    I don't consider myself a paticularly good architect, rather a competent engineer.
                    I solve practical problems in sometimes unintuitive ways, much to the bemusement
                    of my peers. In the future, I hope to land a job in the Cyber Security industry,
                    and in my free time I would like to program games.
